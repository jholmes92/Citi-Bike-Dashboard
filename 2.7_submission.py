    Welcome to the Citi Bike Distribution Analysis Dashboard. As the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, our objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data from Citi Bike facilities. Our goal is to uncover actionable insights to address distribution issues, ensuring a seamless experience for our users and further solidifying our position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

    Context: Citi Bike has experienced increased popularity, particularly since the Covidâ€“19 pandemic, leading to higher demand and distribution challenges. This dashboard serves as a tool to diagnose distribution issues and provide informed recommendations to enhance our logistics model.

    Let's explore the data and discover insights to optimize our bike distribution strategy.

By visualizing these two key factors together, we aim to uncover insights into how weather conditions impact bike usage patterns, user behavior, and distribution strategies.
    
    Bike Rides: Weekly count of bike rides, reflecting user demand and usage patterns.
    
    Temperature: Weekly average temperature, influencing user preferences and biking activity.
    
    Understanding the correlation between these variables can help optimize distribution strategies, address availability issues, and enhance the overall biking experience for users across the city.

    **Insights:**
    
    The interactive chart above showcases the weekly trends of bike rides and temperature in New York City.
    
    - The rise of temperature, and bike rides, are virtually in lock step with one another in March, April and May. We can assume that the warmer weather will drive business growth moving into the summer months.
    
    - Business throughout the summer months is at it's strongest, but I also noticed that it continues to stay relatively strong despite temperatures beginning to drop. This is interesting, as we saw temperature and business grow identically in the spring, but that is not the case in the fall.

    - There are 3 main takeaways from these images. First, in the 'Trips' image, we can see clearly where our top 10 or so most popular routes are located. This allows us to understand why that might be as additional geographical analysis can be made around those addresses
    -  Secondly, the 'Starting Point' image gives us a clear idea of where we not only are covering in NYC but where it becomes brighter and more dense. This means certain areas have more riders, which means the need for more units, more opportunity, and ultimately, more sales.
    - Lastly, I'd like to direct your attention to the 'Start to End | Arc' image. We can see that in the center of the city, there is a large swath of rides that leave the downtown core and move outward. We can learn from this, and use similar visualizations on the map to determine our locations that require the greatest need, and as I mentioned in the last point, the most sales.
